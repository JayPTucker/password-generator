## Description:
UPDATED (2/19/20):
This Website is a Random Password Generator.  It has been thoroughly coded and designed to work as perfect and smoothly as possible. The project took about 10-20 hours to even do, due to the fact of me starting on it and not really have a clue how to create what I wanted at first.  However, now that I have FINISHED the Application (Minus the Fact of Future Bug fixes if Necessary) I was able to learn a lot along the way, especially when it comes to JavaScript.  I sadly had to rewrite my JS code more than 4 times due to things not adding up in the long-run.  Though, with all the struggle I went through, it was definitely worth it.

My main inspiration was just knowing that I could definitely create this.  I've been great with HTML and CSS in the past and there was no way I couldn't figure out JS, so I toughed through it and was able to learn quite a few new things.  I am not a Professional with JavaScript, no, but I am getting there.  I don't plan on giving up anytime soon, either.  The stress and headaches come with the Learning Curve of this.. especially this project!

This Project will easily solve anyones issue of; "I need a new, complicated, yet secure password!"  Just set the amount of Characters you want, Select what kind of Characters, Generate, and Copy!  Then make sure you have it written down somewhere or saved through Chrome/Edge so it's not lost.

## Installation:
1.  Clone the file from my 
[GitHub](https://github.com/JayPTucker/password-generator)
2.  Put it somewhere you'll remember (Best Choice for Easy Access: In a Folder on your Desktop)
3.  Open GitBash and cd directly into the directory.
    - "cd desktop" > "cd JayPTucker.github.io" > Done!
4.  Once you're CD'd inside of the Repository, type "code ." into GitBash and hit Enter.
5.  VSCode should open (Or any other Software you use to code).
6.  From there, you have all your files you need to begin coding.
7.  Have fun!  Send me what you did! :D
